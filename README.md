# LANE DETECTION 

Lane coloration has become popular in real time vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). The main emphasis of this
paper is to find the further ways which can be used further to improve the result of lane detection algorithms. Noise,
visibility etc. can reduce the performance or the existing lane detection algorithms. The methods developed so far are
working efficiently and giving good results in case when noise is not present in the images. But problem is that they
fail or not give efficient results when there is any kind of noise or fog in the road images. The noise can be anything
like dust, shadows, puddles, oil stains, tire skid marks, etc.


1. Introduction

Traffic accidents have become one of the most serious problems in today's world. Roads are the mostly chosen modes of
transportation and provide the finest connections among all modes. Most frequently occurring traffic problem is the
negligence of the drivers and it has become more and more serious with the increase of vehicles.
Increasing the safety and saving lives of human beings is one of the basic function of Intelligent Transportation
System (ITS). Intelligent transportation systems are advanced applications which aim to provide innovative services relating
to different modes of transport and traffic management. This system enables various users to be better informed and make
safer, more coordinated, and smarter use of transport networks.These road accidents can be reduced with the help of road lanes or white markers that assist the driver to identify the road area and non-road area. A lane is a part of the road marked which can be used by a single line of vehicles as to control and guide drivers so that the traffic conflicts can be reduced.
